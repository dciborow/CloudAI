## Table Creation
CREATE TABLE Throughput (

## How many messages in all have been recieved
select count(*) from Throughput;

## What distinct errors have been detected
SELECT DISTINCT(Error) as Error, Count(*) as Total, Client

## What is the average latency of all succesful calls
Select SentTime, AVG(Latency) AS AverageLatency , COUNT(*) AS ProcessedCount

## List the errors for each client 
select Error, Client, COUNT(*) from Throughput

## Get information on each client in the test pool
