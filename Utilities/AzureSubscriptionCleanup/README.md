# Azure Subscription Cleanup Scripts
<sup>Created by Dan Grecoe, a Microsoft employee</sup>

The scripts in this folder can be used to either batch clean up unused resource groups in your Azure Subscription. List all types of resources in your Azure Subscription or list all resources of a certain type in your Azure Subscription.

Resources and resource groups have a way of multiplying in an Azure Subscription over time. Some of them become obsolete but it can be unclear who created it and for what purpose. However, these resources continue to cost you on a weekly or monthly basis. 

Periodically cleaning up or at least understanding what is in your subscription is vitally important.

Use the scripts to clean up resources or resource groups.

## Resource Group Level 
The scripts in this folder can be used to identify resource groups in your subscription. Identify resource groups that have little activity associated with them. Delete unlocked resource groups in your subscripiton


## Resource Level 
The scripts in this folder can be used to list all resources by type and region. Create a collection of all resources across your subscription by a specific resource type. Delete individual resources.
